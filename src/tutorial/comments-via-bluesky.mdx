## Setup

1. Set the `BLUESKY_IDENTIFIER` in your `src/config.ts` file to your bluesky handle (without the `@`).

2. Then just post a link to your blog post on bluesky and comments will be shown on your blog posts, looking something like this:

<div class="max-w-md rounded-xl overflow-hidden border border-base-200 dark:border-base-800 shadow-lg not-prose">
  ![showing comments]($assets/posts/comments.png)
</div>

That's it!

## Notes

No "add comment" link is shown if there is no post by you on bluesky linking to your blog post.

Once you post a link to your blog post on bluesky, likes will also be shown (see [likes via bluesky](../likes-via-bluesky)).
If you don't want to show likes, you can disable them using the `disableLikes` option in your post options.

```yml
disableLikes: true
```

Alternative, you can also disable comments by setting the `disableComments` option in your post options and just show likes.

```yml
disableComments: true
```
